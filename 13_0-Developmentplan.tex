\section{Development plan}\label{sec:development_plan}

This section describes the development plan for the METIS data reduction software to comply with the the specifications given in the in the ESO dataflow deliverables standards document (\cite{1618}). The time schedule is subject to regular updates and review in close cooperation with

\begin{itemize}
    \item AIT team: coordination of the pipeline implementation schedule
    \item ICS team: coordination with ICS implementation schedule to test the data flow between ICS and pipeline and check consistency of FITS keywords
    \item Detector group: coordination when detector characteristics become available
    \item ESO: check consistency of FITS keywords, QC parameters and coordinate required input to software recipe development (detector persistence, ...)
\end{itemize}

Table \ref{tab:development_schedule} provides an overview of the milestone schedule for the METIS pipeline development.

\subsection{FDR to PAE development plan}
\label{ssec:fdr2pae}

It is planned to monitor the status of pipeline software implementation in regular progress meetings, where, if necessary, specific action items can be defined. Starting after FDR the implementation of the development schedule (\ref{tab:development_schedule}) will be carried out in the subsequent steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Review and adapt the schedule for the pipeline software development after successful PIP FDR in compliance with the METIS DRL Validation and Test Plan (\cite{DRLVT}). A priority list for the implementation of the PIP capabilities will be agreed with the AIT team. It will categorize high, medium and low priorities of pipeline modules for subsystem and system level AIT. Furtheron, a detailed schedule will be set up with ESO regarding updated versions of pipeline package.
    \item Simulated and processed data at T$_{FDR}$ + 6 months: the package includes raw data, intermediate data and science data products for each instrument mode. The simulated data will be used to test the data flow system.
    \item Delivery of the DRS chain skeleton
    \item Updated versions of the pipeline package in previously agreed intervals consisting of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Updated version of the DRL document
        \item Reports on tests performed at the level of pipeline recipes
        \item Test and calibration data
        \item Updated version of the pipeline/QC user manual
        \item Report describing the status of the DRL implementation
        \item List of action items
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{METIS Preliminary Acceptance in Europe (PAE)}
\label{ssec:pae_europe}

PAE completes the METIS AIT phase. At this stage, the pipeline software has reached a maturity level where all components are fully developed and integrated. It is expected that at this point also lab data from the AIT phase will be available for test and validation purposes in addition to the simulated test data package. The pipeline PAE will consist of 3 phases: a test readiness review, an end-to-end simulation of the data flow and the PAE review phase.

\subsubsection{Test Readiness Review}
\label{sssec:trr}

The pipeline package will be carefully reviewed to check its compliance to \cite{1618} approximately 3 months (TBD) before the PAE review. The review requires:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The METIS instrument has been fully assembled, aligned and all tests at subsystem level have been performed
    \item Both simulated data and lab data obtained during the AIT phase are available for verification purposes to cover all relevant instrument modes
    \item Full unit tests have been implemented at the algorithmic level to check requirement compliance
    \item Full error propagation has been implemented to check requirement compliance
    \item A science use case has been assigned to each observing mode
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{End-to-End simulation of the data flow}
\label{sssec:e2e}

The scope of the data flow end-to-end simulation is to validate the full process of pipeline data processing. The process will consist of
\begin{itemize}
    \item One science case per observing mode will be used as demonstrator
    \item Raw data will be processed in final data products
    \item Final consistency checks on the data flow system (FITS keywords, QC parameters, ...)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{PAE review phase}
