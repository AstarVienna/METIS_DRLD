\section{Development plan}\label{sec:development_plan}

This section describes the development plan for the METIS data reduction software to comply with the the specifications given in the in the ESO dataflow deliverables standards document (\cite{1618}). The time schedule is subject to regular updates and review in close cooperation with

\begin{itemize}
    \item AIT team: coordination of the pipeline implementation schedule
    \item ICS team: coordination with ICS implementation schedule to test the data flow between ICS and pipeline and check consistency of FITS keywords
    \item Detector group: coordination when detector characteristics become available
    \item ESO: check consistency of FITS keywords, QC parameters and coordinate required input to software recipe development (detector persistence, ...)
\end{itemize}

Table \ref{tab:development_schedule} provides an overview of the milestone schedule for the METIS pipeline development.

\subsection{FDR to PAE development plan}
\label{ssec:fdr2pae}

Starting after FDR the implementation of the development schedule (\ref{tab:development_schedule}) will be carried out in the subsequent steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Review and adapt the schedule for the pipeline software development after successful PIP FDR in compliance with the METIS DRL Validation and Test Plan (\cite{DRLVT}). A priority list for the implementation of the PIP capabilities will be agreed with the AIT team. It will categorize high, medium and low priorities of pipeline modules for subsystem and system level AIT. Furtheron, a detailed schedule will be set up with ESO regarding updated versions of pipeline package consisting of
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Updated version of the DRL document
        \item Reports on tests performed at the level of pipeline recipes
        \item Test and calibration data
        \item Updated version of the pipeline/QC user manual
        \item Report describing the status of the DRL implementation
    \end{itemize}
    \item Simulated and processed data at T$_{FDR}$ + 6 months: the package includes raw data, intermediate data and science data products for each instrument mode. The simulated data will be used to test the data flow system.
    \item Delivery of the DRS chain skeleton
    \item Delivery of updated versions of the pipeline package in agreed intervals
    \item PAE: delivery of the pipeline package 4 weeks prior to PAE
\end{enumerate}

It is planned to monitor the status of pipeline software implementation in regular progress meetings, where, if neccessary, specific action items can be defined.
