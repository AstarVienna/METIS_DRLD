\section{DRL Functions}\label{sec:drl_functions}


All functions, plugins, macros and data types will be documented using
\emph{Doxygen} which is the standard documentation tool for CPL, HDRL and ESO
pipelines. The reference manual for the pipeline system is created automatically
from the Doxygen strings. This fulfills \REQ{METIS-9355}.

In the function descriptions we have used \CODE{metis_image} and
\CODE{metis_imagelist} instead of \CODE{hdrl_image} and \CODE{hdrl_imagelist} for functions which handle
processed data, to
indicate that the function inputs and outputs will not be a single
hdrl\_image, due to the need to pass the 32-bit data quality flag, as
described in Section~\ref{sssec:metisimageformat}.  A metis\_image will
consist of an hdrl\_image and a cpl\_image, containing the DATA and
NOISE extensions, and QUALITY extension, respectively.
