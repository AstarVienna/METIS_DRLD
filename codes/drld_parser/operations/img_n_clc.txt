==== Science sequence ====

For HCI observing modes:

  * The target (typically a bright star) is always on-axis and used as the NGS for the SCAO
  * The derotator is always in pupil tracking mode (i.e. pupil is always oriented in the same pre-defined direction)

Sky subtraction:

  * The sky subtraction is performed via telescope offsets to an empty sky position. The AO loop is opened for the sky observations, and then subsequently closed when back on target.
