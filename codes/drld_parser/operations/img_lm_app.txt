===== Apodized Phase Plate coronagraphy (APP) in L- or M-band  =====
Science use case example: //Exoplanet search with APP in L-band//


===== Operational procedure =====

==== Preparation ====

  * ETC
  * p2pp kind of OB preparation
  * any special needs?

==== Acquisition ====

The steps prior to AO loop closing are similar to IMG-LM observations. The APP mask is inserted after the AO loop is closed, and a fixed offset is added to compensate for the wedge in the APP.

Template options:
  *  [[metis_img_lm_app_acq|METIS_img_lm_app_acq]]

==== Science sequence ====

For HCI observing modes:

  * The target (typically a bright star) is always on-axis and used as the NGS for the SCAO
  * The derotator is always in pupil tracking mode (i.e. pupil is always oriented in the same pre-defined direction)

Sky subtraction:

  * In APP mode, the target will be moved between two predefined positions on the detector (A and B).
  * A single star using the APP generates three PSFs on the detector - two coronagraphic PSFs and a leakage PSF halfway between the two coronagraphic PSFs. In both positions A and B, all three PSFs should be seen. The PSFs at A and B should not interfere with each other.  
  * Offsets between A and B should be performed using the CFO-PP2 chopper. 

Template options: 
  * [[metis_img_lm_app_obs_fixedoffset|METIS_img_lm_app_obs_FixedOffset]]


===== Calibration data =====

++++
Calibration requirements|
  * flatfielding (daytime WCU, not needed daily?; twilight sky flats?)
  * sky background recostruction/subtraction (chop/dither/stare), align frames (dithered/choped exposures)
  * flux calibration (sky atmosphere modeling + one/few standard observations per night?)
  * psf re-construction?
  * provide data cube or "stacked" result?
