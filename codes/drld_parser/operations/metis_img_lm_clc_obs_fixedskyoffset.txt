==== Science imaging coronagraphy template METIS_img_lm_clc_obs_FixedSkyOffset ====

=== Procedure for METIS_img_lm_clc_obs_FixedSkyOffset ===
 
++++
Setup imager|
  * Move ''IMG-LM PP1 FILT'' to selected filter
  * Remove the neutral density filter (located in one of the wheels in IMG-LM PP1)
  * Set detector parameters (DIT, NDIT, readout mode, cube mode T/F)
++++
++++
Start science exposures|

  * This template moves the telescope alternatively between OBJECT and SKY positions. 
  * The OBJECT position is fixed to keep the bright star in the occulting mask. The number of exposures taken at this position is set by the keyword ''N_OBJECT''
  * The SKY positions are randomly distributed around a position set at a constant distance from the initial telescope pointing. This distance is defined by the parameters ''Sky offset in RA'' and ''Sky offset in DEC''. The dither around this position is calculated to be within a ''Jitter Box Width''. The number of dithered sky exposures is set by the keyword ''N_SKY''.
  * AO loop is closed at the OBJECT position, and opened at the SKY position.
  * Offsets to sky are performed using the telescope offsets, while the dithering can be performed also using the CFO-PP2 chopper.
  * The observing sequence is performed as AB-AB-AB  where AB is a single OBJECT-SKY cycle, including N_OBJECT exposures at the position A, and N_SKY dithers at the position B. The keyword ''NABCycles'' defines the number of AB cycles.
  * At each position start science exposures with DIT/NDIT. 
  * Read-out and save individual exposures, or co-added frames, depending on the ''cube mode'' T/F keyword.

++++
++++
End science exposures|
  * Return back to the initial position
  * Collect headers
  * Merge into one or more data cubes
  * Send cube to ESO Archive
  * Send cube to Pipeline machine or ICS storage (tbd)
  * Go back to Setup Imager until target observations are finished (single OB). For example, to observe in a different filter (but note that this might not be very common in pupil tracking modes).

At the end of the OB:
  * Stop chopper
  * Stop CFO pupil stabilization
  * Stop AO
    * open loop (M4)
    * stop field stabilization (M5)
    * stop registration
    * stop modulation
  * Stop derotator
  * Handover to telescope
    * CCS takes control of M4 and M5
    * Telescope gets ready for next preset

Notes:

  * System should automatically calculate the chopping parameters as a result from the offset list (if offsetting is to be done with the chopper, and not with the telescope)
  * Keyword for chopper parameters set to CFO since the chopper is inside of the instrument, this is to be confirmed.
