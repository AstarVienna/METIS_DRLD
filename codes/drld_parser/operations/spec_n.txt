===== Operational procedure =====

==== Preparation ====

  * ETC
  * p2pp kind of OB preparation

==== Acquisition ====

During the preset, the telescope is sent to the position of the target. The AO NGS is automatically centered on the WFS (no interaction needed). In case of the off-axis NGS (SEQ NGS ISTARGET = F), an internal WFS mirror (field selector) will be tilted such that the off-axis NGS falls exactly onto the WFS.  A through-slit image is taken in order to measure the exact slit position on the detector. The target is then moved to the slit position.

==== Science sequence ====
In long-slit spectroscopy mode, the sky subtraction in N is performed by chopping and nodding the target, typically along the slit, with optional jitters at each position. More complex source geometries might require larger nodding amplitudes, and/or nodding perpendicular to the slit in order to avoid self-cancellation.
