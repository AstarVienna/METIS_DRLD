==== Detector bias determination ====
=== Responsible ===
Science Operations

=== Phase ===
Daytime

=== Frequency ===
Once every day (tbc)

=== Purpose ===
Determine detector bias count level

=== Procedure ===
  * Close all instrument shutters
  * Take a series of 0-second exposures with all detectors

=== Pipeline data products ===
  * Master bias frame

=== Prepared observing blocks ===
(tbd)

=== Prepared templates ===
[[METIS_all_cal_bias|METIS_all_cal_bias]]

=== Pipeline support ===
  * master bias frame: median of all frames

=== Duration ===
5 min

=== Prerequisites ===
None

=== Required Accuracy ===
tbd

=== Expected Accuracy ===
limited by thermal leaks / outside illumination? (tbd)



=== Notes ===
