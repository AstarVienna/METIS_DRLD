==== Detector linearity calibration ====
=== Responsible ===
Science Operations

=== Phase ===
Daytime

=== Frequency ===
Once every year (tbc)

=== Purpose ===
Determine detector linearity curve

=== Procedure ===
  * set WCU BB / flatfield source to appropriate temperature for LM / NQ band, wait for warm-up
  * while warming up: setup instrument for respective observing mode
  * at various temperature (brightness) levels <color #ed1c24>and/or detector DIT (tbc)</color>, take a short series (10, tbc) of observations

=== Pipeline data products ===
  * Detector linearity curve
  * Detector gain

=== Prepared observing blocks ===
(tbd)

=== Prepared templates ===
  * [[METIS_img_lm_cal_DetLin|METIS_img_lm_cal_DetLin]]
  * [[METIS_ifu_cal_DetLin|METIS_ifu_cal_DetLin]] ?
  * [[METIS_img_nq_cal_DetLin|METIS_img_nq_cal_DetLin]]


=== Pipeline support ===
  * Detector linearity curve: potentially complex procedure (for AQUARIUS detector), see recipe from Bonn group developed for VLTI/MATISSE
  * Detector gain: sttdev as a function of average counts (perhaps not possible with AQUARIUS due to ELFN, i.e. excess noise that depends on illumination level)

=== Duration ===
dominated by WCU BB warm-up times (1-2 hours?)

=== Prerequisites ===
None

=== Required Accuracy ===
(tbd)

=== Expected Accuracy ===
tbd
