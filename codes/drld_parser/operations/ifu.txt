===== Nominal IFU spectroscopy (LM) =====
Science use case example: //Kinematic and spatial studies of circumstellar disk dynamics with CO at 4.65 microns//

===== Operational procedure =====

==== Preparation ====

  * ETC
  * p2pp kind of OB preparation
  * preparation GUI to help define FOV 

==== Acquisition ====

The steps prior to AO loop closing are identical to IMG-LM. After that, the LMS pick-off mirror is inserted (90% of the light sent to LMS, 10% to the IMG-LM). For target centering on the IFU, the positional cross-calibration between the IMG and the LMS will be used. This should be precise to within a small fraction of a slice width (a few mas).

==== Science sequence ====

Two options to deal with offsetting to the sky: 

  * Periodic offsets to a pre-defined nearby sky position, alternating between the science target and the sky position, with dithering (Fixed Sky Offset)
  * Any user-defined offset pattern (Generic Offset)
 
All offsets can be performed using the telescope or the CFO-PP2 chopper (TBC).

  * [[METIS_ifu_obs_GenericOffset|METIS_ifu_obs_GenericOffset]]
