=== Responsible ===

=== Phase ===
Daytime

=== Frequency ===
Once every month (tbc)

=== Purpose ===
Determine the relative spectral response function for the L/M band low/medium resolution long-slit imaging spectrograph

=== Procedure ===
  * [[metis_all_cal_lampoff|Take WCU lamp off frames]]. Parameters: T1 (tbd), INS MODE: LMS, WCU FP1 config: grid
  * record the BB spectrum 1
  * set WCU BB to temperature T2 (tbd), wait until temperature is reached
  * close WCU input / output shutters, take a background measurement, open WCU shutters
  * record the BB spectrum 2 with
  * move the grid pattern and repeat <color #ed1c24>(combine with slit loss / distortion template)</color>

=== Pipeline data products ===
  * Relative Spectral Response Function

=== Prepared observing blocks ===
(tbd)

=== Prepared templates ===
(tbd)

=== Pipeline support ===
  * background / dark frame subtraction of raw frames
  * divide observed frames by blackbody spectrum of known temperature to obtain the relative spectral response function
  * <color #ed1c24>describe use of second blackbody measurement</color>

=== Duration ===
  * warm up WCU BB to T1 (30 min?)
  * For each position, take a series of frames (3 min including setup?)
  * step the point sources relative to the slitlets (1/10 l/D steps, ca. 10 steps in total in across slit position; <color #ed1c24>is the along slit direction also required?</color> (probably yes; the RSRF is, after all, dependent on wavelength and detector/field location)
  * switch to T2 (30 min?)
  * repeat the stepping
  * In total 2 hours?

=== Prerequisites ===
none (tbd)

=== Required Accuracy ===
  * relative spectro-photometric accuracy: 10%
  * no calibration error budget yet, but the RSRF can probably get 1/3 of the total budget, 3% accuracy

=== Expected Accuracy ===
  * limited by (imperfect correction for) detector non-linearity?



=== Notes ===
  * <color #ed1c24>Is the procedure for the long-slit RSRF the same as for the LMS RSRF? (two black bodies, using grid, move grid against slit to sample RSRF for different locations in the slit focal plane)</color>
