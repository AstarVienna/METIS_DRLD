==== Acquisition Template METIS_img_lm_acq ====

=== Procedure for METIS_img_lm_acq ===

++++
Preset telescope|
  * send target coordinates to TCS
  * initiate guiding/tracking. Guide star may be chosen by operator (if no coordinates supplied), or use the one specified in the template.
  * wait for signal “arrived at position” / “guiding”
++++
++++
Configure CFO |
  * CFO can be configured while the telescope is presetting
  * ''CFO PP1'': select cold stop PPS-CFO1
  * ''CFO PP1'' (ADC wheel): select ADC (or open position)
  * [comment] the proper one should be selected automatically depending on the airmass in the middle of the observation. Possibly give a warning if there isn't a single optimal ADC to use during the observation (and then suggest doing the observation later?). Could also add observation constraints in p2.
  * Set de-rotator initial angle and start derotator. Options:
    * Field tracking (pupil rotates)
    * Pupil tracking (field rotates; by default used for both HCI and (on-axis) regular imaging)
    * No tracking (stopped). For engineering purposes.
  * Chopper to home position
  * Start chopping if requested; default: no chopping
  * [comment] This is in case we want to or need to try actual chopping (~ 1 Hz offsetting within the field using the CFO-FP2 chopper mirror)
  * ''CFO FP2'' to LM Field Stop
  * LMS pick-off to open
++++
++++
Setup imager|
  * Set ''IMG-N PP1'' to CLOSED (no light on IMG-N system)
  * [comment] IMG-LM PP1 has three wheels. The wheel located exactly in the pupil plane will contain the pupil masks (stops; for coronagraphy), APP, and the grisms. The other two wheels located behind the one in the pupil plane will contain the science filters, and the neutral density (ND) filters (METIS-3953, METIS-3781, METIS-5528).
  * Move ''IMG-LM PP1 MASK/GRISM'' to selected pupil mask (pupil stop PPS-LM for field-tracking observations, spider mask SPM-LM for pupil-tracking observations)
  * Move ''IMG-LM PP1 FILT'' to selected science filter 
  * Move ''IMG-LM PP1 ND'' to selected neutral-density filter (for acquisition of very bright targets)
  * Pupil imaging lens to open
    * a mechanism for pupil viewing. Not located in the pupil plane, probably in front of the detector (tbc). In IMG used for engineering/AIV purposes.
  * Set detector parameters (DIT, NDIT, readout mode)
++++
++++
AO and target acquisition|
  * Details of the AO acquisition are described in \cite{SCAOFa}.
  * Preset AO
    * Set SCAO filter wheel to K if Kmag > 0, otherwise K_ND  
    * Move the field selector ''SCA-PP1 FS'' to the pointing reference position
    * setup WFS (detector and modulator)
    * start WFS
  * Wait for the telescope preset to complete
  * Center the guide star at the pointing reference position
    * Detect decenter
    * apply corrections to the PFS pointing origin
  * Close the pupil position control loop
  * Take over AO control from the telescope
    * close the loop on the METIS WFS with few modes
    * sequential field stabilization mode is the default
  * Optimize mis-registration
    * bootstrap initial mis-registration
    * increase to full AO correction performance
  * Measure the position of the target in the science focal plane.
  * Center the target in the science focal plane using CFO-PP2 chopper.

**Note 1:** The above sequence assumes that the pointing accuracy of the ELT is better than the field selector FoV (2 arcsec). Otherwise, we will do a small search with the SCAO field selector mirror. This is just to be on the safe side, we may not use it (see the Note 2) or only needed during commissioning. 

**Note 2:** there are two parts in the telescope pointing: the telescope pointing itself and the telescope alignment with instrument (installed in the Nasmyth platform which has a relative motion). 

++++
++++
While AO loop is closed|
  * AO controls M4/M5 (via CCS)
    * RTC communicates directly with CCS (no ICS involvement)
  * Monitor range
  * Schedule ROUS maneuver (trigger or postpone the  next execution of major stroke off-loading events)
  * Save WFS data (slopes)
    * TBD when (all the time?)
    * For PSF reconstruction, NCPA removal

Notes:

  * System should automatically calculate the chopper parameters as a result from the list of random jittering offsets (if offsetting is to be done with the chopper, and not with the telescope)
  * Keyword for chopper parameters set to CFO since the chopper is inside of the instrument
