==== Acquisition Template METIS_ifu_vc_acq ====

=== Procedure for METIS_ifu_vc_acq ===

__Note:__ For all modes that use pupil tracking it needs to be investigated how close to the zenith an object can be before the field rotation becomes too fast accurate pupil tracking is no longer possible.

++++
Initialize OB|
  * Stop chopper
  * Stop CFO pupil stabilization
  * Stop AO
    * open loop
    * stop field stabilization
    * stop registration
    * stop modulation
  * Stop derotator
  * Handover to telescope
    * CCS takes control of M4 and M5
    * Telescope gets ready for next preset
++++
++++
Preset telescope|
  * send target coordinates to TCS
  * initiate guiding/tracking. Guide star may be chosen by operator (if no coordinates supplied), or use the one specified in the template.
  * wait for signal “arrived at position” / “guiding”
++++
++++
Configure CFO|
  * CFO can be configured while the telescope is presetting
  * ''CFO PP1'': insert RAP-LM if apodizer is to be used, otherwise move to OPEN position
  * ''CFO PP1'' (ADC wheel): select ADC (default: OUT)
  * [comment] the proper one should be selected automatically depending on the airmass in the middle of the observation. Possibly give a warning if there isn't a single optimal ADC to use during the observation (and then suggest doing the observation later?). Could also add observation constraints in p2.
  * Start derotator (pupil tracking)
  * Chopper to home position
  * Initialize pupil stabilization mirror
  * ''CFO FP2'' to LM field stop 
    * if the ring apodizer is to be used: at this stage the vortex is not yet inserted, which permits to center the target for the SCAO, and move it at the calibrated position at (or very close to) the center of the vortex. Vortex mask is inserted after the AO loop is closed.
  * LMS pick-off to open (acquisition done with the IMG)
++++
++++
Setup imager for target acquisition|
  * Set ''IMG-N PP1'' to CLOSED (no light on IMG-N system)
  * [comment] ''IMG-LM PP1'' has three wheels. The wheel located exactly in the pupil plane will contain the pupil masks (stops; for coronagraphy), APP, and the grisms. The other two wheels located behind the one in the pupil plane will contain the science filters, and the neutral density (ND) filters (METIS-3953, METIS-3781, METIS-5528).
  * ''IMG-LM PP1 MASK/GRISM'': insert RLS-LM (if apodizer is used) or CLS-LM (if no apodizer is used)
  * Move ''IMG-LM PP1 FILT'' to selected science filter 
  * Move ''IMG-LM PP1 ND'' to selected neutral-density filter (for acquisition of very bright targets) 
  * Pupil imaging lens to open
  * Set detector parameters (DIT, NDIT, readout mode)
++++
++++
AO and target acquisition|
  * Details of the AO acquisition are described in \cite{SCAOFa}.
  * Preset AO
    * Set SCAO filter wheel to K if Kmag > 0, otherwise K_ND  
    * Move the field selector ''SCA-PP1 FS'' to the pointing reference position
    * setup WFS (detector and modulator)
    * start WFS
  * Wait for the telescope preset to complete
  * Center the guide star at the pointing reference position
    * Detect decenter
    * apply corrections to the PFS pointing origin
  * Close the pupil position control loop
  * Take over AO control from the telescope
    * close the loop on the METIS WFS with few modes
    * sequential field stabilization mode is the default
  * Optimize mis-registration
    * bootstrap initial mis-registration
    * increase to full AO correction performance
  * Measure the position of the target in the science focal plane.
  * Center the target in the science focal plane using CFO-PP2 chopper.
++++
++++
Setup IFU|
  * insert LMS pick-off
  * ''LMS PP1'': insert RLS-LMS (if apodizer is used) or CLS-LMS (if no apodizer is used)
  * ''LMS PP4'': Select pre-dispersed range (spectral order)
  * ''LMS FP4'': to single order selecting mask (nominal mode)
  * ''LMS PP5'': Select main dispersed range 
++++
++++
Coronagraphic acquisition|
  * ''IMG-LM PP1 ND'': insert the ND filter (optional; only ~10% of the light will be sent to the IMG-LM).
  * Take a short exposure both on LMS and IMG-LM systems. Measure the relative position of the (non-coronagraphic) PSF between the IMG-LM and LMS.
  * CFO FP2 to vortex mask (VPM-L or VPM-M)
  * LMS-PP1 wheel: insert RLS-LMS (if apodizer is used) or CLS-LMS (if no apodizer is used)
  * On IMG-LM, align the star with the VPM center using the chopper or send to the pre-defined position of the VPM center.
  * Accurate centering (closing the QACITS loop):
     * "Science-like” exposures are acquired with the star close to the VPM centre, using the DIT defined for the science exposures, and a ND filter if needed. When the QACITS error signal becomes smaller than a pre-defined threshold, QACITS sends a trigger signal to the ICS.
  * ''IMG-LM PP1 ND'': Remove the ND filter.
++++
++++
While AO loop is closed|
  * Run QACITS algorithm and calculate pointing corrections
    * Tip/tilt correction, 1-Hz repetition frequency
  * Run NCPA removal (PSI) algorithm and calculate the slope offsets (1 Hz). 
  *  Send corrections to SCAO supervisor (ICS)
    * To M4/M5 to correct global slope offsets and tip/tilt
    * These two loops (QACITS and NCPA) run in parallel, in similar time frame (1 Hz frequency)
  * Save WFS data (slopes)
