==== Acquisition Template METIS_img_lm_app_acq ====

In this template the initial steps (until the SCAO loop is closed) are identical to simple imaging procedure.

__Note:__ For all modes that use pupil tracking it needs to be investigated how close to the zenith an object can be before the field rotation becomes too fast accurate pupil tracking is no longer possible.

=== Procedure for METIS_img_lm_app_acq ===

++++
Preset telescope|
  * send target coordinates to TCS
  * initiate guiding/tracking. Guide star may be chosen by operator (if no coordinates supplied), or use the one specified in the template.
  * wait for signal “arrived at position” / “guiding”
++++
++++
Configure CFO|
  * CFO can be configured while the telescope is presetting
  * ''CFO PP1'': select cold stop PPS-CFO1
  * ''CFO-PP1'' (ADC wheel): select ADC (or open position)
  * [comment] the proper one should be selected automatically depending on the airmass in the middle of the observation. Possibly give a warning if there isn't a single optimal ADC to use during the observation (and then suggest doing the observation later?). Could also add observation constraints in p2.
  * Start derotator (pupil tracking)
    * de-rotator will be positioned such that the telescope spiders line up with the spiders in the IMG-LM-PP1 mask; since this mode uses pupil tracking, they will remain aligned (the masks in the IMG cannot be rotated).
  * Chopper to home position
  * Start chopping if requested; default: no chopping
  * [comment] This is in case we want to or need to try actual chopping (~ 1 Hz offsetting within the field using the CFO-FP2 chopper mirror)
  * ''CFO FP2'' to open
  * Initialize pupil stabilization mirror
  * LMS pick-off to open
++++
++++
Setup imager|
  * Set ''IMG-N PP1'' to CLOSED (no light on IMG-N system)
  * [comment] IMG-LM PP1 has three wheels. The wheel located exactly in the pupil plane will contain the pupil masks (stops; for coronagraphy), APP, and the grisms. The other two wheels located behind the one in the pupil plane will contain the science filters, and the neutral density (ND) filters (METIS-3953, METIS-3781, METIS-5528).
  * Move ''IMG-LM PP1 MASK/GRISM'' (mask/grism wheel) to open
  * Move ''IMG-LM PP1 FILT'' to selected science filter 
  * Move ''IMG-LM PP1 ND'' to selected neutral-density filter (for acquisition of very bright targets) 
  * Pupil imaging lens to open
  * Set detector parameters (DIT, NDIT, readout mode)
++++
++++
AO and target acquisition|
  * Details of the AO acquisition are described in \cite{SCAOFa}.
  * Preset AO
    * Set SCAO filter wheel to K if Kmag > 0, otherwise K_ND  
    * Move the field selector ''SCA-PP1 FS'' to the pointing reference position
    * setup WFS (detector and modulator)
    * start WFS
  * Wait for the telescope preset to complete
  * Center the guide star at the pointing reference position
    * Detect decenter
    * apply corrections to the PFS pointing origin
  * Close the pupil position control loop
  * Take over AO control from the telescope
    * close the loop on the METIS WFS with few modes
    * sequential field stabilization mode is the default
  * Optimize mis-registration
    * bootstrap initial mis-registration
    * increase to full AO correction performance
  * Measure the position of the target in the science focal plane.
  * Center the target in the science focal plane using CFO-PP2 chopper.
++++
++++
Coronagraphic acquisition| 
  * Move ''IMG-LM PP1 MASK/GRISM'' (mask wheel) to APP-LM
  * Position the PSF so that the two primary star images do not fall onto a detector channel edge in any of the offset positions.
++++
++++
While AO loop is closed|
  * Run NCPA removal (PSI) algorithm and calculate the slope offsets, with a 1 Hz frequency. 
  *  Send corrections to SCAO supervisor (ICS)
    * To M4/M5 to correct global slope offsets and tip/tilt
  * Save WFS data (slopes)

Notes:

  * System should automatically calculate the chopper parameters as a result from the list of random jittering offsets (if offsetting is to be done with the chopper, and not with the telescope)
  * Keyword for chopper parameters set to CFO since the chopper is inside of the instrument, this is to be confirmed.
