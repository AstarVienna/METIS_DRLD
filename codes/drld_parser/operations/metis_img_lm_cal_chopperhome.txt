===Procedure for METIS_img_lm_cal_ChopperHome ===

This calibration is required since the absolute positioning accuracy of the chopper is much lower than our expected overall astrometric accuracy. Once the chopper is powered on, it does, however, trace its offsets very accurately. With this calibration, the chopper home position is measured as the offset between the K band source (as seen by the SCAO WFS, before the chopper) and the L band source (as seen by the IMG-LM, after the chopper).

Setup WCU|
  * Move periscopic arm to IN
  * Set temperature of the blackbody to specified temperature
  * Wait for about 45 minutes (warming up time, depends on the BB temperature selection)
  * Set ''WCU-FP2.1'' to LM-pinhole
  * Set ''WCU-PP1'' to ELT mask
  * Check the power readout. If the power is detectable, continue. 
  * Set ''WCU-BB-aperture-mask'' to CLOSE
  * take background measurement
  * Set ''WCU-BB-aperture-mask'' to OPEN

Setup CFO and subsystems|
  * Set ''CFO-PP1'' to PPS-CFO1
  * Set ''CFO-FP2'' to FIELD-11
  * Set LMS beamsplitter pickoff wheel to OUT
  * Set the IMG-LM mask to SPM-LM
  * Set the IMG-LM science filter to the specified filter
  * Set the IMG-LM neutral density filter to the specified filter

++++
End Exposure|
  * Collect headers
  * Send file to ESO Archive
