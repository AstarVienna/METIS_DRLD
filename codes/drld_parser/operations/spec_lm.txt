Science use case example: //Spectroscopy of ultra-cool GP/BD “wide” (spatially resolved) companions to stars//


===== Operational procedure =====

==== Preparation ====

  * ETC
  * p2pp kind of OB preparation

==== Acquisition ====

During the preset, the telescope is sent to the position of the target. The AO NGS is automatically centered on the WFS (no interaction needed). In case of the off-axis NGS (SEQ NGS ISTARGET = F), an internal WFS mirror (field selector) will be tilted such that the off-axis NGS falls exactly onto the WFS. A through-slit image is taken in order to measure the exact slit position on the detector. The target is then moved to the slit position.

==== Science sequence ====

In long-slit spectroscopy mode, the sky subtraction in LM is performed by nodding the target between two positions along the slit, with optional jitters at each position.
