(1) **Configure CFO**
''Roy:'' We do not foresee the use of ADCs in the NQ bands.
''Kora:'' Text modified accordingly. 

(2) **METIS_obs_IMG_NQ_AutoChop**
''Roy:'' I think (based on the work of Alex and Leo) that the "standard" chopping "unit" will be a 3-position rather than the classical 2-position pattern. Also, we may chop in 2 dimensions (so we'd have 5 or more positions). This is still all very much TBD, and we don't know the scheme yet, but I'd say it is unlikely that we'll do the classical 2-position "on-off" pattern that is currently in the description.
I updated the description to make this a bit more general, replacing "chop throw + position angle" with "chop positions".

''Kora:'' Thanks Roy. I also modified the fits keyword parameters (although it is still to be seen how exactly do we call these parameters).
