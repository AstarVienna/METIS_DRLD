\section{Summary of the usage of \texttt{molecfit}}\label{app:mf}
This section is intended to be a summary on how the package \texttt{molecfit} will be used for the METIS pipeline. As it will be incorporated in the \ac{IFU} and both \ac{LSS} modes in the same way, we describe here the technical part only once for all pipelines. The overall strategy is described in Section~\ref{ssec:tellcorr}.

\texttt{molecfit} is provided by \ac{ESO} via the \texttt{telluriccorr} package. It incorporates three individual recipes: \texttt{XXX_mf_model}, \texttt{XXX_mf_ca}
