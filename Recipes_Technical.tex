\subsection{Recipes for engineering templates}
\label{ssec:recipes_technical}

\TBD It is not clear (2020-11-19) whether data from maintenance
templates need to be reduced by the pipeline. This section and the
recipes described therein serves as a placeholder and may be removed
later.

\subsubsection{Pupil imaging}
\label{sssec:pupil_imaging}

\TBD This recipe refers to pupil imaging using the science
detectors. Presumably it only contains the most basic reduction
steps. There may have to be separate recipes for the various
subsystems.
