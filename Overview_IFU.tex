\subsection{LM IFU: integral-field spectroscopy}
\label{ssec:overview_ifu}

In general, the workflow is similar to the \ac{LSS} mode,
except the extensive post-processing stage.
The main difference arises from the need to co-add multiple exposures
to achieve the full resolution, since pixel scales are different:
\begin{itemize}
    \item in the along-slice direction, the sampling is sufficient, ie. above the Nyquist rate;
        at $8.2$ mas per pixel;
    \item in the across-slice direction, the sampling is below the Nyquist rate at
        $20.7$ mas per pixel, and dithering/co-adding of multiple exposures is needed.
\end{itemize}

The ratio of these resolutions shows that at least three exposures shifted by one third of the
pixel size are required. The image is then reconstructed on a square pixel grid of
$8.2 \times 8.2 \text{mas}^2$.

The exposures are taken in two perpendicular field rotations,
so that full resolution is obtained naturally in the along-slice direction
and by dithering in the across-slice direction; in the other sequence of three exposures
these directions are swapped.

The association map is shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:IfuAssomap}.
