\subsection{LM IFU: integral-field spectroscopy}
\label{ssec:overview_ifu}

% The \ac{IFU} pipeline has not yet been revised since PDR, hence the
% description in \cite{DRLS} applies.
% For reference, t
The association map is shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:IfuAssomap}.

% Discussion moved to https://github.com/AstarVienna/METIS_DRLD/issues/100
% \TODO{
% We will consider rearranging the recipes to be in line with the
% imaging pipelines. This would entail handling basic reduction and
% background subtraction for of both science and standard exposures in
% common recipes (\CODE{metis_ifu_basic}, \CODE{metis_ifu_background}),
% then having a recipe to analyse the standard observations
% (\CODE{metis_ifu_std_process}). The science exposures are then fully
% calibrated (\CODE{metis_ifu_calibrate}). A full set of exposures would
% then be assembled and restored with a fully sampled PSF in a
% post-processing recipe (\CODE{metis_ifu_combine}).

Two more changes are foreseen in the IFU recipe cascade:
\begin{itemize}
    % https://github.com/AstarVienna/METIS_DRLD/issues/110
    \item Allow telluric standard stars to be used, similarly to the LSS workflow, and

    \item Refactor the recipes such that the common processing steps are in a shared recipe, similarly to the imaging workflows.
\end{itemize}

    calibration tasks that are done at AIT or infrequently during
    operations from tasks done daily. The prefix ``\REC{metis_}'' has been
    omitted from the recipe names to improve clarity.}
